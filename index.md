1) **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I really really enjoyed the backpropagation derivation for attention modules - I felt that I have a true understanding of the mathematics behind the mechanism and that's very rare.

2) **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I'd love to pursue a unique architecture to try an improved performance on critical thinking tasks, like playing games.

3) **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would definitely like to meet much more often with my group. I understand that it will be difficult to find time, but personally I have finished my graduate applications and can spend more time.

4) **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I'd love to pursue more adaptive training techiques. I'm hoping the fact that we've got our pipeline set this quarter should make training much easier.
